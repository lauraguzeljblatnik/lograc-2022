# Hoare logics for WHILE (and STLC)

This file contains 3 projects, depending on which feature X you choose.

## Source material

A good general reference for different kinds of logics (including
Hoare Logic) is the book "Logic in Computer Science" by Huth & Ryan
([link](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/lics/)).

## Goals of the project

* Define a deep embedding of a small imperative programming language
  (commonly called the WHILE language) extended with feature(s) X.

* Features X you can choose from (you can of course suggest your own):
  1. state and exceptions
  2. state and input/output
  3. state and nondeterminism

* Define a deep embedding of Hoare Logic for WHILE + X.

  - In the first instance, instead of the general (possibly) divergent
    while loop construct `WHILE B DO C`, use a terminating for loop
    combinator `FOR E1 to E2 do C` (where you give the lower and upper
    bounds for the loop index, which is then incremented implicitly).

  - Once you have everything working for the terminating variant of
    WHILE, then an additional challenge is to use the delay monad
    to allow possibly divergent computations (like the general while
    loop construct).

* Define a definitional interpreter for WHILE + X.

* Prove that the Hoare Logic is sound with respect to the definitional
  interpreter.

* Possible extension: extend WHILE + X and the Hoare Logic to the simply
  typed lambda calculus (STLC) + X by using Hoare Types/Hoare Monad to
  encode the Hoare triples at the level of STLC's type system.

* A simpler variant of this project will involve defining the
  definitional interpreter into a shallow (graded or parameterised) monad
  in Agda. A more advanced version of this project will involve you using
  [Agda's categories library](https://github.com/agda/agda-categories).

## Suggested background reading materials

A good general reference for different kinds of logics, their syntax,
and semantics is the book "Logic in Computer Science" by Huth & Ryan
([link](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/lics/)).

A good general reference for different kinds of lambda calculi and
programming language features is Types and Programming Languages
(Pierce) (https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/).

The definitional interpreter part of the project will take the form of
an interpretation function from well-typed programs into Agda types
(wrapped in a (parameterised) monad; and into a suitable category, if
using the categories library). For this, see the lecture notes and
exercises on the semantics of propositional logic, together with the
propositions as types correspondence.

### WHILE and Hoare Logic

* Chapter 4 of Logic in Computer Science (Huth & Ryan)

  - overview of program verification in general

  - syntax of the WHILE language

  - syntax of Hoare triples

  - proof calculus / deduction system for Hoare logic

### State, exceptions, IO, and nondeterminism effects/monads

* Notions of Computation and Monads (Moggi)
  (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Moggi91.pdf)

  - an overview of different kinds of computational effects and
    the monads that naturally model them

  - also gives an overview of the basic programming abstractions
    for effectful programming based on monads

### Parameterised monads

* Parameterised Notions of Computation (Atkey)
  (https://bentnib.org/paramnotions-jfp.pdf)

  - definition of a notion of parameterised monads

  - useful if you want to state the definitional interpreter and
    correctness results with respect to an abstract interface of
    effectful computations
